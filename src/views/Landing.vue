  <!--
  "Container" class here is used to control the width span of landing page.
  You might think that applying the container to the Layout.vue component is much more superior,
  but in my opinion, this is better as you can control who to have the entire width or container width
  individually in your view page and not limited by Layout.vue view page.

        Please do note that all of the stuffs here are not standards, but my bias and also my way of
        creating a Vue web app.
